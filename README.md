## What I am learning from this project:

1. My first project with React! I learned how much simpler I was able to iterate and reuse componenents due to React. My previous projects were in JavaScript which was a lot slower. It was difficult at first to become familiar with the way React works but once I became comfortable, I realized the potential and why so many developers use it.

2. The scope is much larger which includes many more moving parts so it's an interesting challenge for me to manage how all of the pieces fit together and make sure things work. Debugging is so important and works as a reminder to keep my code as simple as possible.

3. My last project had simple server routes but this time I am using Express to manage an actual database which is a lot more challenging and interesting. It's not only important to manage the data but the security behind keeping that data safe is a challenging yet pivotal part of the application.
